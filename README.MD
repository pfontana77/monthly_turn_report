# Monthly Turn Report Mod for Imperator: Rome

The **Monthly Turn Report Mod** aims to introduce a sort of monthly turn to avoid the game running on autopilot, especially when max speed is used. Besides pausing the game each month, the mod provides you with a brief report comparing current and previous month values for several factors:

- **Manpower**
- **Treasury**
- **Stability**
- **Political Influence**
- **Military Experience**
